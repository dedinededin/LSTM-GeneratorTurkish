# LSTM-GeneratorTurkish
In this project i used an example of ml5.js and trained my own data to generate Turkish text from a seed text.
The original project is on https://ml5js.org/docs/lstm-example

I only re-design it and used my own trained data.
The data includes 5 books from Sabahattin Ali (Turkish author).

*You can train your own models following [this tutorial](https://ml5js.org/docs/training-lstm).*
